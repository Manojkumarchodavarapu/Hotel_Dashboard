**Hotel Data Analysis - Power BI Dashboard**  

This Power BI project presents a **Hotel Data Analysis Dashboard** designed to evaluate key business performance metrics for a hotel. The dashboard provides insights into **revenue, occupancy rate, RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), average daily rate (ADR), and booking trends** to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. Using **interactive visualizations and dynamic filters**, the report enables users to analyze revenue streams, identify seasonal trends, and optimize pricing strategies. The dataset used is structured to reflect real-world hotel operations, and the dashboard is built with a focus on **usability, efficiency, and business impact**.
